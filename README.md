## Mini Real Estate Floor Selector
This is a simplified prototype of a real estate floor selector app, built as part of a frontend developer assessment for PropertyVisualizer.

## What the App Does
The app allows users to:

- View a list of Towers (Tower A, B, C, D)

- Select a Tower and see 15 floors

- Select a Floor to view 3–4 apartment layouts

- View apartment metadata (area, unit type, room count)

- View a larger apartment layout image on selection

- Enjoy smooth animations and subtle hover interactions

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **React** – For building the component-based UI

- **React Router DOM** – For client-side routing

- **Tailwind CSS** – For styling and responsive layout

- **Vite** – For project setup and fast development

## 🎯 Features
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly

- Hover animation with background darkening and image zoom

- Clean route structure for towers, floors, and layouts

- Modular component design

- Gradient backgrounds and placeholder images



## ⚠️ Known Limitations / Tradeoffs
- The apartment data is static and repeated across all towers/floors.

- Images are locally imported placeholders, not fetched from a database.

- No backend or persistent data.

- Accessibility improvements could be added.

- No unit tests or performance optimizations yet.
